brackets-jshint
=================

A Brackets extension to enable JSHint support. To install, place in your ```brackets/src/extensions/user``` folder.
When installed, you can enable JSHint by clicking 'Enable JSHint' in your View menu.

Currently only the default options are supported. I'm looking for feedback on how to provide ways to customize the options
on each parse.

Issues/Updates
=====
Per feedback from Narciso Jaramillo, I use a checkbox to show enabled/disabled status and move to the item when you click a row.
